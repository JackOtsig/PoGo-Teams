# PoGo-Teams
An exercise in data genereation; a program that generates every possible 3 pokemon team in pokemon go and then rates them by how strong/weak each team is type-wise.

currently not functional. there are over 700 million different combinations and it will take my computer over 2 days even with multithreading so I havent taken the time to
do that yet. also working on the rating algorithm.
